Karen is 42 years old. Karen wants to buy a table, but as new it's too expensive. Karen really wants the table, so she is looking to save some money, and buy it used. 


Our solution is for people who wanna save some money on furniture they wanna buy. There is a larger population of people who wanna buy used products to save money, than to save the earth. 
When going with this we are securing IKEA a circular economy, while creating the solution in a logical manner, and focusing on saving money.

The use of our scripts is simple. The first script called 'IKEA_group23_tables.sql' has to be run, that will create a designated database and tables in to that database. The second script called 'IKEA_group23_data.sql', when ran, will populate the tables with dummy info, we created ourselves.
